# RIS-channel-estimation-using-ML-applications
Developed a DNN-based framework for estimating downlink cascaded channels in RIS-assisted wireless systems, replacing LS/MMSE to cut pilot overhead in high-dimensional BS–RIS–user links. Integrated distributed machine learning with scenario-specific modules, achieving up to 87.5% pilot overhead reduction.
